# Contracts {.unnumbered}

At RMCC, our collaborative research and methodological work are built on a foundation of clear, mutual understanding. The primary tool we use to formalize that understanding is a `contract` (i.e., a short-term or long-term project engagement). To ensure *consistency, security, and ease of collaboration*, every new contract triggers the creation of a *dedicated folder on our secure shared drive*. This standardized structure is *mandatory* and serves as the *single source of truth* for all project materials.

## Contract Repository Basics

-   *One contract → one root folder* on the secure shared drive.
-   All work products (data, code, documents, figures, decisions, and reports) must be stored under this root. <!-- -   Each `project` within a contract has its own subdirectory. A single contract can include one or more projects. -->

## Naming Convention

The naming convention for each `contract` is the following:

> **\[PI Last Name or Institution\], \[Short Project Name\]**

::: fyi
*Good examples*

-   Judy Anderson, RATE
-   Christine Anderson, LAC

Within each `contract`, some directories and files will be created as needed. These directories can range from administrative documents, papers, or some other material.

The naming conventions for the directories and files in our `contract` are as follows:

-   File names should be short but descriptive (less than 25 characters)
-   All lowercase letters
-   Avoid special characters and spaces in a file name
-   Use hyphens instead of spaces to separate words
-   Any names that include the date will use the *ISO 8601* date format (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Standard Contract Structure (Example)

This is what a typical `contract` looks like in our drive:

It is typical to show directory and file organization via a “directory tree”. The directory tree for this project is shown below.

A more detailed example of a `contract` is the following:

Among these, `project` directories (e.g., `regression-analysis/`) contain the bulk of the creation process: code, assets, figures, and compiled products.

Let's review them closely in the next section.
