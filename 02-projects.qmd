# Projects {.unnumbered}

Within each `contract`, *every major statistical analysis* conducted on the contract’s data must have its *own dedicated project subfolder*. This ensures reproducibility, reduces confusion across analyses, and provides a clear audit trail of what was done, when, and by whom.

### General Rules

-   *Each analysis → project subfolder* .\
-   Subfolders must be named descriptively (method, focus, or phase of analysis).
    -   Examples:
        -   `regression-analysis/`
        -   `longitudinal-modeling/`

While there are any of a number of alternative organizational structures that may work in different situations, at RMCC we use a general strategy of creating `projects`. For each `project`, we will have, at a minimum, the following:

-   *assets*
-   *data*
-   *figs*
-   *reports*
-   *scripts*
-   *project.Rproj*
-   *README.md*

### Description of each component

-   *assets*: Supporting files used in the analysis but not generated by it. Examples: bibliographies (*references.bib*), style files, templates, and utility code snippets.These provide consistency across products and keep dependencies explicit.

-   *data*: Analysis-ready datasets and any derived extracts created for this project.

-   *figs*: Figures, tables, and other static visualizations generated by the scripts. Each file should be named with an ISO date or milestone tag to make versions traceable. This separation ensures that reports do not need to regenerate all graphics manually.

-   *reports*: Written products associated with the project: Quarto manuscripts, HTML dashboards, PDF reports, or slide decks.This is the main “deliverables” folder, containing outputs meant for sharing with collaborators, sponsors, or publication.

-   *scripts*: All code used to run the analysis. Scripts must be numbered in execution order (e.g., *00-functions.R*, *01-cleaning.R*, *02-analysis.R*). Each script should be modular, reproducible, and clearly commented. This structure guarantees that others can reproduce results step by step.

-   *README.md*: A plain-text overview of the project folder. It should describe:

    -   The scope of the analysis\
    -   Key datasets used\
    -   Main deliverables expected\
    -   Entry points for running the scripts\
    -   Contact information for the lead analyst

The *README.md* serves as the first stop for anyone entering the folder, making navigation easy.

### R projects

Creating an R project is a way to inform RStudio about which folder is your project's root directory. This also sets R's working directory to your project's root directory making it easier to access data and other files in your .QMD or .R documents. To create an R Project associated with the `project` root directory,

-   Click the project icon in RStudio (it might say `Project: (None)` or something like that) and select `New Project...` (see screenshot below)

![](img/01-new-project.png){fig-align="center" width="428"}

In the project wizard, select:

-   `Existing Directory`,
-   Click `Browse` and select the `project` root directory you created earlier
-   Click `Open`
-   Click `Create Project`

The R Project will then be created and you should now see this project (called `project.Rproj`) in the `project` directory. Our directory tree is now:

```         
└── project/
    ├── assets
    ├── data
    ├── figs
    ├── reports
    ├── scripts
    ├── project.Rproj
    └── README.md
```

Once an R project has been created, it can be opened in RStudio by double-clicking on the `.Rproj` file.

### Benefits

-   **Isolation of analyses**: Each statistical workflow stands alone.\
-   **Transparency**: Easy to trace which scripts produced which outputs.\
-   **Reproducibility**: Easy to make re-runnings.\
-   **Scalability**: Supports multiple simultaneous analyses within one contract.

::: fyi
Every time a new statistical analysis is planned under a contract, the **first step** is to create a **new project subfolder** following this template.\
This rule applies even for exploratory or preliminary analyses.
