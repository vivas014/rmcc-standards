# Q&A {.unnumbered}

This section collects common questions about how we organize and manage `projects` at RMCC. It is intended to clarify expectations and avoid misunderstandings.

## Do we use GitHub or other version control tools?

> No. At RMCC, all analyses are conducted within **R Projects** stored in our **Google Drive contract folders**. This ensures that data, code, and outputs are always in a single secure location, consistent with our compliance obligations. While GitHub and other version control systems are useful for software development, they are not appropriate here because:
- Many of our projects involve sensitive or restricted-use data.  
- External repositories may introduce unnecessary risks for data sharing.  
- Google Drive already provides version history, recovery, and collaborative editing.  

## How do we track versions of scripts and outputs?

> 
- Scripts are **numbered sequentially** (`00-`, `01-`, `02-`, â€¦) to indicate their order of execution.  
- Google Drive keeps a **file version history**, so prior versions can be recovered if needed.

## What if multiple people are working on the same script?

>
- Only **one person at a time** should actively edit a script file.  
- If collaboration is needed, break the workflow into multiple smaller scripts (`01-cleaning.R`, `02-analysis.R`, etc.) so work can be parallelized.  

## What if I need to run a new analysis?

> Every new major statistical analysis requires a **new project subfolder** inside the `contract`.  
Follow the structure described in [Projects](02-projects.qmd):  
- `scripts/`  
- `data/`  
- `reports/`  
- `figs/`  
- `assets/`  
- `README.md`  
This keeps analyses reproducible, isolated, and easier to manage.  

## What happens at the end of a project?

> 
- Deliverables are finalized in `reports/`.  
- The project subfolder is archived but **not deleted**.  
- Access permissions are reviewed and unnecessary accounts are removed.
